### Using Optimized Database Operations

```python
from db import optimized_paginate, bulk_update_optimized

# Paginated queries
result = await optimized_paginate(
    collection=trips_collection,
    query={"status": "active"},
    page=1,
    limit=50,
    sort=[("startTime", -1)]

```python
from route_utils import RouteResponse, handle_exceptions, validate_location_exists

@handle_exceptions()
async def my_endpoint():
    # Automatic error handling
    result = await some_operation()
    return RouteResponse.success(data=result)
